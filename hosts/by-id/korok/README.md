# Korok

`Korok` is a WIP towards a generic image which contains no secrets and a generalized hardware configuration with the intent that it can be installed by anyone anywhere with minimal effort.

Currently has much work to be done in support of that goal.

- [ ] user password (or entire file) needs override
- [ ] ssh keys need easy-override, for any others that may want to use it. Unless you want me to have free access to your computer ðŸ¤¯
- [x] ensure no syncthing
- [ ] generic monitor configuration (can I set wallpaper without knowing monitor id?) --  *half completed*
- [ ] override location with a generic one for wlsunset
- [ ] git user info needs override
- [ ] add ability to generate iso install images
- [ ] probably more, [reach out](https://github.com/fitzhawke/soxyn#-contact) or file an [issue](https://github.com/fitzhawke/soxyn/issues/new) if you have any trouble

Will possibly continue on to make `Hinox` and `Bokoblin` afterwards, as a personal and a generic image for non nixOS systems (like darwin) with the same goals.
