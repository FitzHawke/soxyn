# SOXYN Notes

Using this as a location to keep track of notes and how-to documentation.

- [TODO](./TODO.md): rough notes on uncoming ideas/features. Basically where I write down random thoughts of things to look into later. Here be dragons
- [ISSUES](./ISSUES.md): a list of known issues running this configuration on my hardware and notes on what remedies have been tested/considered
- [docs](./docs/): documentation/tutorial/thoughts on running that particular application. Could eventually be used as a basis for a tutorial style blogpost
- [wip](./wip/).md: reference notes make while working on that particular component. Much will eventually be scrapped, but some will be cleaned up and moved to docs
